# Student Performance Case Study
## Student Exam Performance Merit America Capstone Project

### About
Welcome to my case study about student exam performances, where I take a deep dive into potential factors that may affect the average students academic performance. I collectected the data that I needed, then proceeded to clean and sort the data. I then was able to create visualizations that revealed insights about the data. Using R programming I pulled all the necessary data forward and compared numeric columns to categorical columns. Summing up my findings with a step by step report. 

Here is a dashboard of the overall performances
